### Build and run
Download this project and Gradle, and cd to the local directory.
Build and run in one step: `gradle build run`

### Usage
For demoing purposes, now it supports only a very poor range of commands.
- `/add {word} {definition}`: add `word` to the dictionary with definition `definition`
- `/get {word}`: get the definition of `word` (previously registered with `/add`)
- `/quit`: quit the program
Note that this demo showcases not the features, but rather the architecture.
Clean architecture is good, clean architecture is life.
